You will start with simple, multi-layer dense networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons), and continue on to more complicated architectures. The course will cover how to build models with multiple inputs and a single output, as well as how to share weights between layers in a model. We will also cover advanced topics such as category embeddings and multiple-output networks. If you've ever wanted to train a network that does both classification and regression, then this course is for you!"
